The described program is a classic example of an enterprise database. It takes into account information about the work of stores: the date, the number of goods sold, prices, numbers of checks, sections, stores and names with article numbers. As a result of the work, a summary of the total revenue for a given store can be obtained.

The program is developed using the operating system Windows 10, but can be used, both in later and earlier versions of this system. The output data can be displayed on the screen or be written to a file of different types. The program can be used at enterprises to analyze and account for the profits of various stores, facilitating the work of accountants and reducing the time spent.
